"""
 SD conditioning

 Create a GUI window to make user enter parameters
 And implement the actions of presenting reward 
 according to whether the rat has achieved the criterion
 within the duration of presenting SD

 The circuit:
 * Red LED attached from pin 11 to +5V
 * Green LED attached from pin 12 to +5V
 * 560 Ohm resistors attached from pin 11&12 to GND
 * Servo attached to pin 13
 * Button attached to pin 3
